Starting the course over. Intent to finish this time. 
Course recommened for NOT beginners. Atleast a basic understanding of React and Node.js
  If course proves too difficult, perhaps reveiw these materials. A starting point would be Traversy Media on YouTube crash courses.
POSTMAN  --  Postman is used to make HTTP requests to the server. We are using it because we won't have the front end of the app available yet, so this allows us to test out what we're doing to our project.
1.3.4:10  --  mentions something about Priettier setting Disable Languages. setting allows you to use emmet within JSX:
"emmet.includeLanguages {
	"javascript": "javascriptreact"
}
Research NoSQL databases. Document based, not relational.
Mongo DB Atlas
